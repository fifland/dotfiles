# Dotfiles
#### A simple collection of Linux config and setup scripts mostly for Arch and Debian.

## What's inside?

* Install scripts for Arch and Debian based systems
  * Pacman and AUR packages
* `.zshrc` Config file for the Zsh
* `.gitconfig` Config file for git
* `.vimrc` and `vim` Advanced config files for vim
* SBT Plugin configuration files
* Emacs config with Prelude

## Install Scripts
The install scripts can be used to install frequently used software.
On Arch everything useful for a desktop system is installed.

The Debian installer is mostly targeted on Debain and Ubuntu server installations, therefore nothing requiring an X-Server is installed

### Arch
On Arch the folowing software will be installed:
#### Pacman
* Zsh

* Gradle
* Docker + docker-compose
* Texlive + Biber
* wkhtmltopdf
* Firefox

* Google Chrome
* rbenv + ruby-build
* Oracle Java JDK + JFX Scenebuilder
* Jetbrains Toolbox
* Insync - Goole Drive Client
* Drawio
